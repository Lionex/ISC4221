# ISC4221: _Scientific Algorithms II_

>[This course offers stochastic algorithms, linear programming, optimization techniques, clustering and feature extraction presented in the context of science problems. The laboratory component includes algorithm implementation for simple problems in the sciences and applying visualization software for interpretation of results.](https://www.sc.fsu.edu/undergraduate/courses/657-isc-4221)

This repository hosts my files from labs, homework, class, and more.


- **Part I** - Introduction to Algorithm Design and Analysis
- **Part II** - Random Processes
- **Part III** - Graph Theory
- **Part IV** - Data Mining & Clustering
- **Part V** - Optimization (Linear and dynamic programming)
- **Part VI** - Feature Extraction and Pattern Recognition
- **Part VII** - Computational Geometry

Also included is my final project for my class which is a set of [visualization](https://glfmn.github.io/ISC4221/) for graph search algorithms.
